# Notes on this data
These are example output files from CLAMR with the correct parameter formatting.
There are some important caveats about this data:
- Data with the `_OLD` suffix were collected using an old (and potentially improper) parameter collection method from CLAMR.
  - These files are not useless and does serve as a good example of the format the scripts use to parse the data, however the actual data should not be used for any papers or claims made about performance of the application.
- Files with `reproducible` in the name have greater amounts of information and can be used to (eventually) reproduce a communication pattern much more exactly.
