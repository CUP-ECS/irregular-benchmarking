# L7 Docs
This is a copy of the L7 library that underpins CLAMR's irregular communication.
Specifically, this code is copied from the [CUP-ECS fork of CLAMR](https://github.com/cup-ecs/clamr) which takes advantage of neighbor collectives instead of point-to-point communication.
For more information on this library and the changes that our lab has made, please see the `README-NBR.md` file in this directory.
